# Klippy

This repo was autogenerated using tools at https://github.com/Laikulo/kalico-tooling.

It contains a python-packaged version of kalico's host daemon from https://github.com/Laikulo/Kalico.

This repo contains patches necessary to run as a python package, as well as a few other patches that I use personally.

To figure out what git version this corresponds to, check klippy/.version, it will contain the version of kalico that was repackaged into this repo.
